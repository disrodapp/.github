Disrod is a project that was created with the purpose of being able to message each other during school

## Appreciating the Two Year anniversary of Disrod (29/03/2023)

I am pleased to commemorate today as the two-year anniversary of Disrod, and I hope you join me in celebrating this milestone. Disrod was initially developed exclusively with Godot Engine, but as users began to notice certain features lacking, such as copy and paste functionality, it became necessary to switch to a new programming language. After careful consideration, I opted to use JavaScript, given its prevalence in web development.

The transition from Godot Engine to JavaScript presented some challenges, as I had to learn new technologies and adapt to a dynamic language with its fair share of bugs and issues. In response, I began experimenting with Node.js, which enabled me to run JavaScript code as a server for the currently hosted version of Disrod. However, managing the application's backend in JavaScript proved increasingly difficult, which led me to explore TypeScript. This language, similar to JavaScript, adds types and checks to catch bugs before release, making development more streamlined and efficient for both the front and backend.

To further enhance the front-end, I learned and tested various frameworks, including Angular, React, Vue, and Blazor, ultimately selecting Vue as my framework of choice for Disrod's front-end. Although all was going well, a disastrous event occurred when the entire backend was inadvertently deleted, and despite my best efforts, I was unable to recover it. At that point, I turned my attention to Go, also known as Golang, as an alternative backend language due to its better development capabilities, including a reduction in unpredictability and greater productivity. Since then, I have made significant progress in the development of Disrod's backend, which includes the ability to create and edit user accounts, as well as create servers and chats within those servers.

Currently, my focus is on ensuring that the code written for Disrod works as intended by rigorously testing it. The frontend development is currently on hold, as I am the sole developer working on the project, and it's easier to design the frontend around the backend rather than the other way around. However, I am confident that Disrod's development is on track to be completed by the start of the next school year. Although this is not a guarantee, it is the current projection based on the current development pace.

I would like to express my gratitude to all who have taken the time to read through this update and have been part of the growth of Disrod thus far. Your support has been instrumental in making Disrod what it is today.
